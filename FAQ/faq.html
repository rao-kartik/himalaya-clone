    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Can you provide me with the exact amount of each ingredient in your formulas? In other words, how many milligrams of each ingredient make up the formula</button>
     <div class="content">
   <p>Himalaya herbal formulas are proprietary, which means that they are protected by trademark. It is the labeling rights of all manufacturers to present a proprietary formula with one total milligram amount. Every botanical ingredient is an integral part of the synergistic function of the formula, which is uniquely designed to support all relevant systems in the body, but to give a detailed recipe of amounts would be inviting duplication and endangering our trademarked products and their utmost quality.

    To develop such a comprehensive herbal formula, and to back each formula with a sufficient set of clinical trials that proves the formula to be safe and effective, is an 8-10 year process. Because Himalaya formulas are sold as herbal pharmaceuticals and OTC products in many countries around the world, our demand for the highest standards of excellence a part of our business model.
    
    Since its inception, the company has focused on developing safe, natural and innovative herbal products that help people worldwide. Today, over 300,000 doctors endorse Himalaya products worldwide, and consumers in more than 80 countries rely on Himalaya to support their health. We trust this builds confidence in the comprehensive and proprietary nature of our formulas.</p>
